/**
 * Stops the create wizard opening at all once the plan's event limit is reached.
 *
 * The backend refuses the create either way (clientEvent.createEvent), but that
 * answer only arrives after five steps of typing — the limit is knowable before
 * the first field, so it is said before the first field.
 *
 * Both numbers come from `/client/event-options`, the call the wizard makes
 * anyway, and `events_used` is counted server-side exactly as the create counts
 * it — DELETED events included. The events list is deliberately not used for
 * the count: it shows live events only, so it would read 4 of 5 while the create
 * was refused.
 *
 * Fail-open: while the numbers are loading or absent (an older backend sends
 * neither) the wizard opens. A reporting gap should not stop somebody creating
 * an event they are entitled to — the backend still has the last word.
