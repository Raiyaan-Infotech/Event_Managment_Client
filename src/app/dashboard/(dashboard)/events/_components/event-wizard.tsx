/**
 * The six-step event wizard, used by BOTH routes.
 *
 *   /dashboard/events/create        <EventWizard />
 *   /dashboard/events/[id]/edit     <EventWizard eventId={n} />
 *
 * It lives here rather than in the create route because "Continue Editing" on a
 * draft has to reopen the very same form. Duplicating 800 lines to change a
 * POST into a PUT is how the two drift until a field added to one is missing
 * from the other.
 *
 * ── EDIT MODE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `eventId` switches three things and nothing else: where the initial values
 * come from, whether step 5 POSTs or PUTs, and the wording. The steps, the
 * validation and the plan gating are shared, which is the point.
 *
 * The prefill runs ONCE, guarded by a ref. Re-running it on every render of the
 * query would overwrite whatever the user had just typed each time TanStack
 * refetched in the background.
 *
 *
 * ALL SIX STEPS ARE REAL. Steps 1 and 3 read the plan-scoped taxonomy and menus
 * from `/client/event-options`; step 5's "Create Event" POSTs to
 * `/client/events` and only advances to step 6 when the server answers.
 *
 * THE QR CODE. The backend issues it inside the same transaction that writes
 * the row, so the create response already carries `qr_token` and step 6 renders
 * the code with no second request. What the image encodes is the ENCRYPTED
 * token itself — a scanner returns an opaque `EVQ1.…` string, and only
 * `POST /client/events/qr/decode` can turn it back into event details.
 *
 * STILL PRESENTATIONAL: the invitation layout in step 5 (its QR is a
 * placeholder, because no event exists to encode until step 5 is submitted) and
 * the share tiles on step 6.
 *
 * PLAN GATING IS ENFORCED TWICE. The dropdowns only offer what the plan allows,
 * and the server re-checks every id on the way in — so a hand-rolled POST
 * cannot buy more than the UI shows.

                              The step asks for two different kinds of thing: what
                              the event IS (its name, hosts, when it happens) and
                              what the INVITATION says (venue, organiser, contact,
                              footer). Interleaving them across a plain two-column
                              grid put unrelated fields next to each other and made

                              column follows one subject. Pairs that genuinely
                              belong together (start/end date, phone/email) nest as
                              a two-column row INSIDE a panel.

                                      filled with what was typed on steps 1-4.
