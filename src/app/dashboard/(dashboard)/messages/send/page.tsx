/**
 * Send Message.
 *
 * ── ⚠ NOTHING IS DELIVERED YET ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No WhatsApp, SMS or SMTP provider is configured. Pressing Send RECORDS the
 * campaign and one row per recipient, and the screen says so in the server's
 * own words — `channels[]` carries the state and the reason, so this file has
 * no sentence of its own to go stale, and the banner disappears by itself the
 * day a provider is wired.
 *
 * ── THE THREE NUMBERS ON THIS SCREEN COME FROM THE SERVER ───────────────────
 * Recipient count, the group breakdown and the merge-field preview are all
 * resolved by `POST /messages/preview`, even though the browser has the guest
 * list and could compute them. That endpoint is the same code the SEND uses, so
 * the review step and the send cannot disagree about who is reachable — which
 * is exactly how a "816 recipients" turns into 804 delivered with nobody able
 * to say why.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE DESIGN SHOWS THAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY ─────────────────────────
 * **Estimated Cost / Credits.** There is no credit ledger anywhere in this
 * system — no table, no balance, no price per message. "0 Credits" beside a
 * send is a number that means nothing, and "2 Credits" would be invented.
 * The tile that would have held it reports the real constraint instead.
 *
 * **Delivery Estimate: High.** Nothing measures deliverability, and there is no
 * provider to measure. A confidence rating for an integration that does not
 * exist is the one claim on this screen nobody should make.
 *
 * **Template (Optional) / View Templates / Save as Template.** There is no
 * message-template table. A picker with nothing behind it is a control that
 * looks broken rather than unbuilt.
 *
 * ── ⚠ TWO EDITORS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF MESSAGE ──────────────────
 * EMAIL gets the rich text editor — an email body IS html, and that is what
 * the admin panel's editor produces.
 *
 * WHATSAPP does NOT, and must not. WhatsApp is a plain-text protocol: it
 * renders `*bold*` and `_italic_`, not `<b>`. Feeding it html would deliver
 * `<p>Hi Arjun</p>` to the guest, literally, tags and all. So that channel
 * keeps a plain field whose toolbar writes WhatsApp's own markers.
 *
 * Which one appears follows the channel, so neither can be used on the wrong
 * one by accident.
 */

/**
 * Look and wording per channel.
 *
 * WHICH channels appear is NOT decided here — the buttons render from
 * `composer.channels`, which the server serves. This map only says how one
 * LOOKS once the server has offered it, so a channel can be added or withdrawn
 * without a frontend release and this screen can never offer one the send
 * would reject.
 *
 * `sms` keeps an entry only so a historical row stays describable.
