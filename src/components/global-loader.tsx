/**
 * ── GLOBAL LOADING RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every screen shows a loader, and no page has to remember to add one.
 *
 * This watches TanStack Query itself: if ANY query is fetching or ANY mutation
 * is in flight, the overlay shows. Because every screen fetches through the
 * shared hooks, a new page is covered the moment it is written — there is no
 * per-page wiring to forget, which is exactly how pages ended up shipping
 * without a loader before.
 *
 * Route transitions (the gap before a page's code even runs) are covered
 * separately by loading.tsx in the dashboard route group. Between the two,
 * nothing is uncovered.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Wait this long before showing anything.
 *
 * Without it, a cached or sub-100ms response makes the overlay flash on and off
 * — which reads as a glitch and is worse than no loader at all. Anything slower
 * than this is a wait the user should be told about.
