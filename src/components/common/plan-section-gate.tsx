 * Blocks a portal SECTION the client's plan does not include.
 *
 * The sidebar already hides such a section (see `section` in lib/navigation.ts);
 * this is the same rule for someone who types the URL or follows an old link.
 * Without it, hiding the row would be cosmetic — the page would still open.
 *
 * Not a security boundary on its own: the section's API calls are not gated by
 * the plan server-side. What this guarantees is that the portal never presents
 * a section the plan does not include.
 *
 * Paths outside every gated section (Dashboard, My Events, Billing, …) pass
 * straight through and never wait on the plan lookup.
