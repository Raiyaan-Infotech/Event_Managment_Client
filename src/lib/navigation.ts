/**
 * Client portal sidebar.
 *
 * Mostly flat — a client manages a handful of areas, and the collapsible groups
 * the template shipped with were one click of ceremony per item. Only an entry
 * with real children gets a chevron.
 *
 * ── THE GUEST MODULE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every guest screen breadcrumbs from **Guests** in the designs
 * (`Guests > Add Guest`, `Guests > Manage Groups`, `Guests > Import Guests`,
 * `Guests > Send Message`, `Guests > Messages`), so the routes nest the same
 * way and the sidebar mirrors it. A nav that disagrees with the breadcrumb
 * leaves people unable to tell where they are.
 *
 * Messages keeps its own top-level entry as well as the breadcrumb parent,
 * because it is a destination in its own right — the Analytics cards link
 * straight to `/dashboard/messages` and `/dashboard/rsvps`.
 *
 * Children are listed most-used first, not alphabetically: "All Guests" is what
 * someone wants nine times out of ten, and Import is the rare one.
 *
 * > **`url` must be the real route.** `isActive()` in AppSidebar resolves the
 * > highlight by longest-prefix match over THIS list, so an entry pointing at a
 * > path that does not exist silently steals the highlight from one that does.
 *
 * ── `ready` ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `false` means the page is not built yet, and the sidebar renders it disabled
 * with a Soon chip rather than as a link to the `[...slug]` "coming soon"
 * placeholder. A nav item that navigates to a dead end is worse than one that
 * says it is not ready — the first looks broken, the second is honest.
 *
 * Flip it to `true` as each page lands. Nothing else needs changing.
 *
 * ── `section` — THE PLAN DECIDES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * An entry with a `section` slug shows ONLY when the client's plan grants that
 * menu on the website (`/client/event-options` → `menus` slugs + `portal_sections`).
 * `PlanSectionGate` applies the same rule to the page itself, so a typed URL
 * cannot reach a section the sidebar hides. Entries without `section` —
 * Dashboard, My Events, Templates, Notifications, Billing, Settings — always show.
 *
 * The slugs are `event_menus` rows in the admin's Menu Management: `rsvp` is the
 * existing event menu; the rest are 'portal' group rows created by
 * `apply-portal-section-menus.js`. Rename one here and there together.
